== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is your solution free? =

Our business model is relying on the idea of a freemium model as we provide a simplified do-it-yourself ordering platform for free, easy to use by anyone. There are no hidden fees, commissions or contracts.

However, we do have a set of premium features (which are more complex) that the customers can choose to pay for if they find them useful for their business (like online payments or branded mobile apps).

= Can I take orders without the restaurant app? =

We do not support, nor encourage, an email, fax or desktop solution for taking orders, and there are many good reasons why we chose to provide an app instead. Shortly put, your online sales will be low if you take orders without the app we provide.

One way to increase your business is to provide existing customers a truly great service so that they will order again and again. The online ordering experience is part of that service. If you can accept and confirm orders within seconds plus giving an individual delivery / pickup time, your customers will be delighted.

= How can I print the orders? =

Please see the complete guide [here](https://www.gloriafood.com/how-to-print-restaurant-receipts).

= Can I customize the look & feel of the widgets? =

You can fully customize the styles of the See MENU & Order and Table Reservation buttons.

The colors and fonts in the ordering widget cannot be changed, as we are trying to focus the attention of your customer on the food, the ordering and the checkout process. This is why we carefully designed the widget using neutral colours on purpose. Moreover, as the menu is your dynamic ever-changing sales content, we have crafted everything with web-friendly fonts that renders consistently over any browser or device thus avoiding misalignments or nasty overlapping of fresh edits.
